You will step into the role of a junior data analyst for a retail company and apply your skills to evaluate customer behavior, satisfaction, and promotional impacts. By following the outlined process, you will gain experience in experimental design, statistical testing, and actionable decision-making.\n","\n","Your task is not only to conduct the analysis but also to reflect on how these techniques help solve real-world problems that businesses face daily.\n","\n","By completing this lab, you will have:\n","- Practiced designing and executing statistical analyses in a real-world scenario.\n","- Reinforced your understanding of test selection and assumptions.\n","- Applied statistical results to business decision-making.\n","- Developed skills in communicating insights effectively through visualizations and reports.\n","\n","### Business Scenario Questions:\n","Imagine you are a junior data analyst working for a retail company that operates stores in three distinct regions: City Center, Suburb, and Rural. Your manager has tasked you with analyzing customer behavior and preferences across these locations. The goal is to help the company answer two key questions:\n","1. Do customer spending patterns, satisfaction levels, and product preferences differ across store locations?\n","2. Do promotional periods result in significantly higher spending compared to non-promotional periods?\n","\n","Spending Across Location:\n","\n","- Business-relevant MDE: Absolute difference in spending of 15% or more\n","- Justification: This represents enough of a difference to warrant location-specific strategies (inventory, staffing, etc.)\n","\n","\n","Ratings Across Locations:\n","\n","- Business-relevant MDE: 1.0 point difference between locations\n","- Justification: On a 10-point scale, a one point difference is noticeable and actionable for customer service improvements\n","\n","Promotional Spending:\n","\n","- Business-relevant MDE: A $15 increase from non-promotional periods\n","- Justification: Promotional costs typically reduce margins by ~15-20%. Need at least 25% increase in spending to justify promotional costs. This aligns with industry standards for promotional ROI\n","\n","Your task involves designing and conducting an analysis using the provided dataset to derive actionable insights. You will apply statistical concepts and techniques such as experimental design, test selection, hypothesis testing, and result interpretation. This process mimics real-world industry scenarios where junior analysts evaluate business performance using data.\n","\n","The data focuses on four variables:\n","- Amount spent by customers (in dollars)\n","- Customer satisfaction ratings (scale of 1 to 10)\n","- Product category preferences (Electronics, Clothing, Groceries)\n","- Purchase type (Promotional vs. Non-Promotional)\n","\n","Your analysis will inform decision-making around marketing strategies, store operations, and promotional campaigns.\n","\n","### Setup\n","\n","In this cell, import all the libraries you'll need for your analysis.
